### Experience with Design and Construction Related Contracts

Mary Feeney has been crafting design, construction, procurement, technology, consulting, and services project and facility related agreements on behalf of owners (and occasionally to contractors and subcontractors) during the entirety of her time providing legal services and as a substantial component of her practice.  She employs different approaches for each project, tailored to the needs of the client and the project.  These include:
<ol type="a">
  <li> developing standard forms of agreement for a client’s use on different types of projects, such as a fixed price basic contract form for smaller, less complex construction projects to  agreed-upon modifications to AIA contract forms for more complex projects, </li>
  <li>  creating entirely new contract forms such as a hybrid design-build agreement that incorporates a negotiated pricing during the design and preserves the owner’s flexibility to modify, suspend, or terminate the project as may be necessary; </li>
  <li> drafting and negotiating master services agreements on behalf of university clients for a variety of services such as for facilities and project management, environmental services, operational/vendor services, and technology licensing </li>
  <li> drafting contract templates (including alternate clauses) for consulting and vendor services that are able to be used on routine matters with little (or no) review by counsel; and </li>
  <li> developing contract addenda for clients that can be provided in response to a vendor’s pre-printed “standard” form to include the provisions that are essential to the client’s own business, regulatory, and risk management requirements. </li> 
</ol>


As most of Mary’s practice is in representing institutional and other non-profit and commercial owners who build, retain, and operate program facilities core to their mission, Mary’s focus is on preserving and protecting the long-term owner’s interests and providing flexibility for changes in the mission or needs of the owner.
